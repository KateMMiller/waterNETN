NETN water database views exported to specified path
}
\description{
This function exports NETN water package views from the database that generates the views as
individual .csv files, or as a zip file with the dataset name (NETN_Water_Data_Package), and the date it
was zipped. The exported .csv or .zip files can then be imported via importData(). This function is primarily
for internal use to create flat files that users can import to run functions in this package without having
a connection having MS Access installed. Must first import the views in the current R session.
